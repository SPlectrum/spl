# SPL Project GitHub Issues Analysis

## Overview

Analysis of GitHub issues for the SPlectrum/spl project as of May 26, 2025. The project currently has **47 open issues** and **95 closed issues**, indicating active development and maintenance.

## Issue Categories and Patterns

### 1. App API Enhancement Issues

The majority of current issues focus on implementing and enhancing the `spl/app` API functionality:

#### Core App Operations
- **#143**: Implement `spl/app/run` for JS script with input arguments
- **#142**: Implement `spl/app/run` for JS script without input arguments  
- **#141**: Implement `spl/app/exec` for batch of commands with input arguments
- **#140**: Implement `spl/app/exec` for batch of commands without input arguments
- **#139**: Implement `spl/app/wrap` to wrap scripts into actions with input arguments
- **#138**: Implement `spl/app/create` with input arguments
- **#137**: Implement `spl/app/create` without arguments
- **#132**: Implement `spl/app/wrap` to wrap scripts into actions without input arguments

**Pattern**: Systematic implementation of app API methods with both input argument variants, suggesting a comprehensive API design approach.

#### App API Design
- **#101**: Design app API (1/2) - Research phase
- **#100**: Implement `spl/app/create` action to create commands from a batch - Research phase

### 2. Package Management Issues

Several issues relate to the package system we analyzed:

#### Package API Improvements
- **#129**: Amend `spl/package` API so package filepaths do not contain root folder (cleanup)
- **#130**: `spl/blob` `spl/package` Refactor - All entries to be records (refactor)
- **#135**: `spl/app/help` reimplement package/api/method listing (cleanup, 0/1)

#### Package Storage and Operations
- **#131**: `spl/blob` and `spl/data` Remove `../` for workspace storage key (cleanup)
- **#104**: `spl/package/remove` does not remove parent folder (bug, question)

### 3. System Architecture and Infrastructure

#### Core System Design
- **#102**: Design Runtime and Client setup (documentation, enhancement, Research)
- **#110**: Think how to capture success/failure of asynchronous action into the originating request (enhancement, question, Research)
- **#85**: Create lifecycle processes with associated clients (0/2, documentation, enhancement)
- **#84**: Create bootloader and destroy routines (enhancement)
- **#83**: Create a standalone full client install package (enhancement)

#### Library and Workspace Enhancements
- **#136**: `spl` library: upgrade `spl.wsExists` to operate on a list of URIs (enhancement)

### 4. Issue Classification by Labels

#### By Priority/Type
- **Enhancement**: Most issues (majority of the 47 open issues)
- **Task**: Implementation-focused issues
- **Feature**: New functionality development
- **Bug**: Limited number, indicating stable codebase
- **Research**: Design and planning phases
- **Documentation**: System design and setup documentation

#### By Development Phase
- **Cleanup**: Refactoring and optimization (issues #129, #131, #135)
- **Refactor**: Structural improvements (issue #130)
- **Research**: Design and planning (issues #101, #102, #110)

## Development Patterns and Insights

### 1. Systematic API Development
The project follows a methodical approach to API development:
- Each API method implemented with and without input arguments
- Consistent naming conventions (`spl/app/run`, `spl/app/exec`, `spl/app/wrap`)
- Comprehensive coverage of use cases

### 2. Milestone-Driven Development
Issues are organized under milestone **"v0.4 Introduce TDD, expand on Clients and AVRO Continuation"** (61% complete, due May 26, 2025), indicating:
- Test-driven development adoption
- Client system expansion
- AVRO schema integration

### 3. Active Maintenance
- All recent issues opened by **jules-tenbos** (3 days ago)
- Consistent labeling and categorization
- Regular milestone tracking

### 4. Quality Focus
- Limited bug reports suggest stable core functionality
- Emphasis on enhancement and feature development
- Systematic cleanup and refactoring efforts

## Technical Implications

### 1. App API Priority
The concentration of issues around `spl/app` API suggests this is a critical development area:
- Command execution and batch processing
- Script wrapping and action creation
- Input argument handling standardization

### 2. Package System Maturity
Package-related issues focus on refinement rather than core functionality:
- Path handling improvements
- Storage optimization
- API consistency

### 3. Architecture Evolution
Infrastructure issues indicate platform maturation:
- Runtime and client setup design
- Lifecycle process management
- Standalone installation capabilities

## Recommendations for Development

### 1. Immediate Priorities
Based on issue frequency and labels:
1. Complete `spl/app` API implementation (issues #143-#137)
2. Resolve package path handling (issues #129, #131)
3. Address the package removal bug (#104)

### 2. Medium-term Focus
1. Complete app API design research (#101, #100)
2. Implement runtime and client setup (#102)
3. Develop lifecycle processes (#85)

### 3. Long-term Goals
1. Standalone client installation (#83)
2. Bootloader and destroy routines (#84)
3. Asynchronous action handling (#110)

## Project Health Indicators

### Positive Indicators
- **High activity**: 47 open issues with recent updates
- **Systematic approach**: Methodical API development
- **Quality focus**: Limited bugs, emphasis on enhancement
- **Clear milestones**: Organized development phases

### Areas for Attention
