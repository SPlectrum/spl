# Simplified Test Suite Implementation Plan

## Overview

This simplified plan creates a dedicated test app in the `spl/apps/` folder that contains test command files. Tests will be executed manually using the `./spl` command from within the test app directory.

## Core Principle

**Use what exists**: The SPL platform already has robust command execution and app infrastructure. Create a test app that contains simple test command files that can be executed manually using `./spl spl/app/exec -f test-file.txt`.

## New Testing Methodology (Updated 2025-05-27)

### Debug Flag Testing Approach

The new testing methodology leverages the debug flag (`-d`) with SPL commands to provide comprehensive execution tracing and validation. This approach uses:

1. **Test Definition Files**: Simple command files in `batches/` directory that use SPL commands with debug flag
2. **Test Data Files**: Separate data files in `data/` directory containing test content
3. **Debug Execution**: Commands executed with `-d` flag for detailed execution traces

#### Example: Blob Module Testing

**Test Definition** (`batches/blob-test-get.txt`):
```
-d spl/blob/get -r apps/test-suite -d data -f test.txt -e text
```

**Test Data** (`data/test.txt`):
```
this is a test file.
```

#### Debug Flag Benefits

- **Comprehensive Tracing**: Debug flag provides detailed execution information
- **Validation Data**: Debug output shows exactly what was loaded and processed
- **Performance Metrics**: Execution timing and duration tracking
- **Error Detection**: Detailed error information when operations fail
- **State Inspection**: Complete view of data structures and execution flow

#### Execution Pattern

```bash
cd spl/apps/test-suite
./spl spl/app/exec -f blob-test-get.txt
```

The debug flag (`-d`) in the test definition ensures that:
- File loading operations are traced
- Data content is validated
- Execution pipeline is fully logged
- Performance metrics are captured
- Any errors are comprehensively reported

## Implementation Strategy

### 1. Create Test App Structure

**`spl/apps/test-suite/spl.js`**
```javascript
// Copy from existing app (e.g., spl/apps/test2/spl.js)
// This provides the SPL execution environment for the test app
```

### 2. Test Definition Files with Debug Flag

Each test definition file uses the debug flag (`-d`) to provide comprehensive execution tracing. Test files are organized by API module with one file per method.

#### Blob API Test Examples

**`spl/apps/test-suite/batches/blob/get-test.txt`**
```
-d spl/blob/get -r apps/test-suite -d data/blob -f test-file.txt -e text
```

**`spl/apps/test-suite/batches/blob/put-test.txt`**
```
-d spl/blob/put -r apps/test-suite -d data -f output.txt -c "Test content for blob put operation"
```

**`spl/apps/test-suite/batches/blob/contents-test.txt`**
```
-d spl/blob/contents -r apps/test-suite -d data/blob
```

#### Console API Test Examples

**`spl/apps/test-suite/batches/console/log-test.txt`**
```
-d spl/console/log "Testing console log functionality with debug tracing"
```

**`spl/apps/test-suite/batches/console/warn-test.txt`**
```
-d spl/console/warn "Testing console warn functionality with debug tracing"
```

#### Data API Test Examples

**`spl/apps/test-suite/batches/data/read-test.txt`**
```
-d spl/data/read -r apps/test-suite -d data/data -f records.json
```

**`spl/apps/test-suite/batches/data/write-test.txt`**
```
-d spl/data/write -r apps/test-suite -d data -c "Test data record with timestamp"
```

#### Execute API Test Examples

**`spl/apps/test-suite/batches/execute/initialise-test.txt`**
```
-d spl/execute/initialise -r apps/test-suite
```

**`spl/apps/test-suite/batches/execute/set-pipeline-test.txt`**
```
-d spl/execute/set-pipeline -r apps/test-suite -p "spl/console/log|spl/console/warn"
```

### 3. Test Data Files

Test data files are organized by API module and contain sample content for testing operations. All temporary files and test data are stored within the `apps/test-suite/data/` directory.

**`spl/apps/test-suite/data/blob/test-file.txt`**
```
This is a sample text file for blob operations testing.
It contains multiple lines to verify proper file handling.
```

**`spl/apps/test-suite/data/blob/test-data.json`**
```json
{
  "message": "Sample JSON data for blob testing",
  "timestamp": "2025-05-27T14:45:00Z",
  "data": {
    "items": ["item1", "item2", "item3"],
    "count": 3
  }
}
```

**`spl/apps/test-suite/data/console/messages.txt`**
```
Sample log message for console testing
Warning message for console testing
Error message for console testing
Trace message for console testing
```

**`spl/apps/test-suite/data/data/records.json`**
```json
{
  "records": [
    {"id": 1, "name": "Test Record 1", "value": "data1"},
    {"id": 2, "name": "Test Record 2", "value": "data2"}
  ]
}
```

# SPL Test Suite App

## Overview

This is a dedicated SPL app for testing core SPL functionality. It contains test command files in the `batches/` directory that can be executed using the standard SPL app execution pattern.

## Running Tests

Navigate to the test-suite app directory and execute individual method tests:

```bash
cd spl/apps/test-suite

# Run individual blob method tests
./spl spl/app/exec -f blob/get-test.txt
./spl spl/app/exec -f blob/put-test.txt
./spl spl/app/exec -f blob/contents-test.txt
./spl spl/app/exec -f blob/copy-test.txt
./spl spl/app/exec -f blob/move-test.txt
./spl spl/app/exec -f blob/delete-test.txt

# Run individual console method tests
./spl spl/app/exec -f console/log-test.txt
./spl spl/app/exec -f console/warn-test.txt
./spl spl/app/exec -f console/error-test.txt
./spl spl/app/exec -f console/trace-test.txt

# Run individual data method tests
./spl spl/app/exec -f data/read-test.txt
./spl spl/app/exec -f data/write-test.txt
./spl spl/app/exec -f data/queue-test.txt

# Run individual execute method tests
./spl spl/app/exec -f execute/initialise-test.txt
./spl spl/app/exec -f execute/set-pipeline-test.txt
./spl spl/app/exec -f execute/next-test.txt
./spl spl/app/exec -f execute/execute-test.txt
./spl spl/app/exec -f execute/complete-test.txt

# Run individual package method tests
./spl spl/app/exec -f package/create-test.txt
./spl spl/app/exec -f package/save-test.txt
./spl spl/app/exec -f package/load-test.txt
./spl spl/app/exec -f package/deploy-test.txt
./spl spl/app/exec -f package/remove-test.txt
```

## Expected Results

- All commands should execute successfully (status: green)
- Debug flag provides comprehensive execution tracing
- File operations should complete without errors and show detailed loading information
- Data operations should show proper queue handling with debug traces
- Console operations should display messages with execution context
- Package operations should manage test packages correctly with detailed logging
- Execution logs will be stored in `commands/requests/` and `commands/responses/`
- Debug output shows exactly what data was loaded, processed, and executed

## Troubleshooting

- If tests fail, check the `commands/responses/` directory for detailed execution logs
- Review error messages in console output
- Verify module availability and argument syntax
- Ensure test environment has proper permissions
```

## Manual Test Validation

### Success Indicators
1. **Execution Status**: All commands complete with green status
2. **Console Output**: Test messages appear correctly in output
3. **File Operations**: Blob operations create, read, and delete files successfully
4. **Data Operations**: Queue operations handle records properly
5. **No Errors**: No error messages in execution pipeline
6. **Log Files**: Proper request/response logs created in `commands/` directory

### Failure Investigation
1. Check execution logs in `commands/responses/` directory
2. Review error messages in console output
3. Verify module availability and argument syntax
4. Ensure test environment has proper permissions

## Implementation Timeline

### Week 1: App Setup and Core Tests
1. Create `spl/apps/test-suite/` directory structure
2. Copy `spl.js` from existing app (e.g., test2)
3. Create `batches/` directory
4. Write console-tests.txt and verify execution
5. Write blob-tests.txt and verify file operations

### Week 2: Complete Coverage
1. Write data-tests.txt and verify queue operations
2. Write execute-tests.txt and verify pipeline functionality
