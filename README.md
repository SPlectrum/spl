# spl

This is the wrapper module within which SPlectrum runs.  
It contains functionality for install management.

This module will go through serveral phases.
The first phase will have minimal functionality so it can function as a boot process for the platform going forward.

The subsequent iterations will be detailed at a later date.

This module is responsible for the self-extracting install file and the overall framework.
It will be primed with the end result of *hello-splectrum*.
