This file tracks the project's progress using a task list format.

2025-05-26 20:46:00 - Initial Memory Bank creation and project analysis.

## Completed Tasks

- Memory Bank initialization and structure creation
- Project documentation review (README.md, spl-package-overview.md)
- High-level architecture understanding established
- Core API modules identified and documented
- Project goals and milestones documented

- Detailed analysis of spl/app/exec module and file-based command execution
- Test command execution and output analysis completed
- Test suite implementation strategy documented
- Request/response logging system analysis completed
- Simplified test suite implementation plan created (docs/current/simplified-test-suite-plan.md)
- Comprehensive issue management system established with GitHub CLI integration
- Documentation organized with current/archive/future structure
- Local project issues created (#150-157) avoiding GitHub conflicts

## Current Tasks

- **Test Suite Implementation**: Ready to begin actual implementation using established plan
- **Issue Tracking**: Local issues (#150-157) created and ready for execution
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive task breakdown and implementation guide completed
- **GitHub Integration**: Historical and future issues documented for complete project visibility

## Next Steps

- Begin Issue #150: Create spl/apps/test-suite/ directory structure and copy spl.js from existing app
- Implement Issue #151: Write console-tests.txt command files and verify execution
- Implement Issue #152: Write blob-tests.txt command files for file operations
- Continue with remaining module tests (data, execute, package)
- Document test execution procedures and validation criteria
- Establish foundation for future test automation enhancements
[2025-05-27 14:11:00] - Fixed command parsing issue: Updated spl/blob/get.js to use 'encoding' parameter instead of 'format' to match get_arguments.json changes.
[2025-05-27 14:14:00] - Completed Issue #150: Test Suite App Structure - spl/apps/test-suite/ directory structure is fully functional with spl.js, batches/ directory, and standard SPL app patterns.
## Current Tasks - PRINCE2 Work Package Management

[2025-05-27 18:21:00] - **Active Work Package: Issue #151 (Blob API Testing)**
- **Work Package Purpose**: Validate blob API operations using debug flag methodology
- **Deliverables**:
  - Functional [`blob-test-get.txt`](spl/apps/test-suite/batches/blob-test-get.txt) command file
  - Validated encoding parameter fix in [`blob/get.js`](modules/spl/blob/get.js)
  - Test data fixtures in [`apps/test-suite/data/`](spl/apps/test-suite/data/) directory
  - Debug execution trace validation procedures

**Work Package Status**: In Progress (80% complete)
**Quality Criteria**: Debug flag execution produces clean traces with expected blob operations

## Next Steps - Just-in-Time Planning

[2025-05-27 18:21:00] - **Immediate Next Step (Detailed)**:
1. **Execute blob test validation** - Run debug flag test on current blob-test-get.txt
2. **Verify encoding parameter** - Confirm blob/get.js encoding fix works correctly
3. **Document test results** - Capture debug trace output for validation baseline
4. **Complete Work Package** - Mark Issue #151 as complete with lessons learned

**Subsequent Work Packages (High-Level)**:
- **Issue #152**: Data API testing (start after #151 completion)
- **Issue #153**: Execute API testing (start after #152 completion)
- **Issue #154**: Package API testing (start after #153 completion)

**Stage Completion Criteria**: All core API modules have validated test suites with debug flag methodology
