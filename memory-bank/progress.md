2025-05-26 20:46:00 - Initial Memory Bank creation and project analysis.

## Completed Tasks

- Memory Bank initialization and structure creation
- Project documentation review (README.md, spl-package-overview.md)
- High-level architecture understanding established
- Core API modules identified and documented
- Project goals and milestones documented

- Detailed analysis of spl/app/exec module and file-based command execution
- Test command execution and output analysis completed
- Test suite implementation strategy documented
- Request/response logging system analysis completed
- Simplified test suite implementation plan created (docs/current/simplified-test-suite-plan.md)
- Comprehensive issue management system established with GitHub CLI integration
- Documentation organized with current/archive/future structure
- Local project issues created (#150-157) avoiding GitHub conflicts

## Current Tasks

- **Test Suite Implementation**: Ready to begin actual implementation using established plan
- **Issue Tracking**: Local issues (#150-157) created and ready for execution
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive task breakdown and implementation guide completed
- **GitHub Integration**: Historical and future issues documented for complete project visibility

## Next Steps

- Begin Issue #150: Create spl/apps/test-suite/ directory structure and copy spl.js from existing app
- Implement Issue #151: Write console-tests.txt command files and verify execution
- Implement Issue #152: Write blob-tests.txt command files for file operations
- Continue with remaining module tests (data, execute, package)
- Document test execution procedures and validation criteria
- Establish foundation for future test automation enhancements
[2025-05-27 14:11:00] - Fixed command parsing issue: Updated spl/blob/get.js to use 'encoding' parameter instead of 'format' to match get_arguments.json changes.
[2025-05-27 14:14:00] - Completed Issue #150: Test Suite App Structure - spl/apps/test-suite/ directory structure is fully functional with spl.js, batches/ directory, and standard SPL app patterns.
## Current Tasks

[2025-05-27 15:04:00] - **Active Test Suite Development**: Currently implementing blob API tests using debug flag methodology. Working on Issue #151 (blob-tests.txt) with focus on:
- Blob get operations with encoding parameter validation
- Test data management in apps/test-suite/data/ directory
- Debug flag execution tracing for comprehensive validation
- File processing integration testing

## Next Steps

[2025-05-27 15:04:00] - **Immediate Priorities**: 
- Complete blob API test validation with debug flag methodology
- Finalize Issue #151: blob-tests.txt command files implementation
- Continue with Issue #152: data API testing
- Document debug flag testing patterns and validation procedures
