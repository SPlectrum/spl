# Active Context

This file tracks the project's current status, including recent changes, current goals, and open questions.

2025-05-26 20:46:00 - Initial Memory Bank creation and project analysis.

## Current Focus

- Analyzing the SPL project structure and understanding the modular architecture
- Documenting the core functionality and API organization
- Understanding the execution pipeline and data layer implementation
- Reviewing the command processing and package management systems

## Recent Changes

- Memory Bank initialized for SPL project documentation
- Project context established based on README.md and package overview documentation
- Identified key module structure: execute, data, package, command, record, schema, avro, blob, app, console, error, void

## Open Questions/Issues

- Current development status and active milestone (v0.2 vs v0.3)
- Specific implementation details of the execution pipeline
- Data layer storage mechanisms and AVRO integration status
- Package installation and deployment procedures
- Testing and validation approaches for the modular architecture
- Integration points between different API modules
- Performance considerations for the minimal implementations
2025-05-26 20:51:00 - Confirmed modular API architecture with single concern principle implementation.
2025-05-26 20:57:00 - Completed app API analysis revealing shared data structure pattern and method coordination.
2025-05-26 22:02:00 - Completed execute API analysis revealing sophisticated pipeline management and execution flow control patterns.
2025-05-26 22:06:00 - Completed data API analysis revealing Kafka-style data layer abstraction with unified record structures.
2025-05-26 22:11:00 - Completed blob API analysis revealing traditional filesystem operations with workspace integration and acknowledged limitations.
2025-05-26 22:13:00 - Noted that spl/command API is deprecated and will be discarded - excluded from analysis.
2025-05-27 00:24:00 - Executed test command analysis revealing comprehensive testing infrastructure capabilities.

## Current Focus

- **Test Suite Implementation Documentation**: Completed comprehensive issue management system
- **Documentation Organization**: Structured docs with current/archive/future separation
- **Issue Tracking**: Created local issues (#150-157) with GitHub integration
- **Next Phase**: Ready to begin actual test suite implementation

## Recent Changes

- Successfully executed `./spl -d spl/app/exec -f test-commands.txt` in test2 environment
- Analyzed execution output showing 65ms successful pipeline execution
- Created simplified test suite plan in `docs/current/simplified-test-suite-plan.md`
- Created detailed implementation tasks in `docs/current/test-suite-implementation-tasks.md`
- Established comprehensive issue management system with GitHub CLI integration
- Organized documentation structure: docs/current/, docs/archive/, docs/future-issues.md
- Created local project issues (#150-157) avoiding conflicts with GitHub issues (#1-143)
2025-05-27 01:58:00 - Simplified test suite implementation plan created focusing on app-based testing approach.
2025-05-27 02:54:00 - Completed comprehensive issue management system and documentation organization.

## Open Questions/Issues

- Test data management and fixture organization for app-based tests
- Error scenario testing and failure recovery validation
- Future automation possibilities while maintaining app-based structure
- Implementation timeline coordination with other project priorities
## Current Focus

[2025-05-27 15:04:00] - **Test Suite Implementation Active**: Currently working on blob API testing with debug flag methodology. Open tabs show active development on:
- Test data files (`spl/apps/test-suite/data/test.txt`)
- Blob API implementation (`modules/spl/blob/get.js`)
- Blob test commands (`spl/apps/test-suite/batches/blob-test-get.txt`)
- File processing functionality (`modules/spl/app/process-file.js`)

## Recent Changes

[2025-05-27 15:04:00] - **Active Development Session**: Test suite implementation is progressing with focus on blob API testing and validation. Debug flag testing pattern is being applied to validate blob operations with comprehensive execution tracing.
