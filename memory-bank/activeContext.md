# Active Context

This file tracks the project's current status, including recent changes, current goals, and open questions.

2025-05-26 20:46:00 - Initial Memory Bank creation and project analysis.

## Current Focus

- Analyzing the SPL project structure and understanding the modular architecture
- Documenting the core functionality and API organization
- Understanding the execution pipeline and data layer implementation
- Reviewing the command processing and package management systems

## Recent Changes

- Memory Bank initialized for SPL project documentation
- Project context established based on README.md and package overview documentation
- Identified key module structure: execute, data, package, command, record, schema, avro, blob, app, console, error, void

## Open Questions/Issues

- Current development status and active milestone (v0.2 vs v0.3)
- Specific implementation details of the execution pipeline
- Data layer storage mechanisms and AVRO integration status
- Package installation and deployment procedures
- Testing and validation approaches for the modular architecture
- Integration points between different API modules
- Performance considerations for the minimal implementations
2025-05-26 20:51:00 - Confirmed modular API architecture with single concern principle implementation.
2025-05-26 20:57:00 - Completed app API analysis revealing shared data structure pattern and method coordination.
2025-05-26 22:02:00 - Completed execute API analysis revealing sophisticated pipeline management and execution flow control patterns.
2025-05-26 22:06:00 - Completed data API analysis revealing Kafka-style data layer abstraction with unified record structures.
2025-05-26 22:11:00 - Completed blob API analysis revealing traditional filesystem operations with workspace integration and acknowledged limitations.
2025-05-26 22:13:00 - Noted that spl/command API is deprecated and will be discarded - excluded from analysis.
2025-05-27 00:24:00 - Executed test command analysis revealing comprehensive testing infrastructure capabilities.

## Current Focus

- **Test Suite Implementation**: Analyzing existing testing infrastructure and designing comprehensive test framework
- Understanding file-based command execution through spl/app/exec
- Leveraging request/response logging system for test validation
- Designing automated test execution and validation framework

## Recent Changes

- Successfully executed `./spl -d spl/app/exec -f test-commands.txt` in test2 environment
- Analyzed execution output showing 65ms successful pipeline execution
- Documented comprehensive test suite implementation strategy in `docs/test-suite-implementation-analysis.md`
- Identified existing testing infrastructure: file-based execution, request/response logging, modular validation

## Open Questions/Issues

- Test execution optimization and parallel processing capabilities
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines for automated testing
- Performance benchmarking standards and thresholds
- Test data management and fixture organization
- Error scenario testing and failure recovery validation
